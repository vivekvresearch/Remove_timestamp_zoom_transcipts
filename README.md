## Removing timestamp from zoom transcipts
### Version: 1.0
#### Things to note:
1. Make sure the transcript is in the .txt format
2. Make sure that the file is either located in the same path as the jupyter file or make sure the .txt file is uploaded using jupyter.
3. This is code is designed for one file at a time. Multiple upload will be updated soon.
4. I have checked this code only for zoom generated transcripts
5. TODO generating a new line based on the speaker
